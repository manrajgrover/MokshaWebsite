Moksha Website

#### Get started
Use
```
bower install
```
to install dependencies.

Also edit _bower.json_ to add your names to the project. Keep it alphabetically
ordered.

#### Roadmap
* [x] Use bower for project management.
* [ ] Create *assets* folder and thus create its children directories *js* and *css*.
* [ ] Create different static HTML files for each mock-up using same assets(js/css).
* [ ] Integrate completed static files into a _Main.html_.
* [ ] Add animations and finishing to the design.
* [ ] Go have a beer until something else comes up.
