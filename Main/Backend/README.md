# Register-and-login

Database - login-register

Table - users

1. user_id

2. username

3. password

### Testing

#### For Login

Create a dummy in database and set active = 1

It can be logged in

#### For Registration

Register normally through the link and verify in the databse. But it can't be 'logged in' since e-mail confirmation is in works for the time being.
